# Money Manager Project
A small group project that focused on writing modular, well-commented, code as well as testing that code using JUnit testing methods.

This program is designed to use a text interface to simulate a functioning banking system. The features of this program are as listed:
- Opening and closing bank accounts per customer:
  * Checkings
  * Savings
  * Money Market
- Depositing and withdrawing from existing bank accounts
- All accounts will automatically acure interest dependent on the account type, customer information, loyalty status, etc.
- Ability to display a person's bank accounts and their information

The project was coded in the Java language using both the IntelliJ and Eclipse IDEs. All major classes, functions, and methods are commented to describe their inputs, outputs, functionality, and which partner worked on the said block of code. Extensive testing was performed on the major classes used in the program with JUnit testing and some of our final JUnit testing classes have been kept inside of the source folder.

As per the requirements, we have created a UML diagram that can be found in the project documentation folder.

This project was created by Pujan Patel and Martin Colucci for Rutgers CS213 in Fall 2020
